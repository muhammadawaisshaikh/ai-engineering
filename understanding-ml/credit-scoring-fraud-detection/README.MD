# Finance - Credit Scoring and Fraud Detection

## Problem
Banks and fintech platforms aim to detect abnormal behavior in transactions that could indicate fraudulent activity. In this example, we use synthetic data to demonstrate how Isolation Forest helps detect outliers in transaction behavior.

## Key Features
1. transaction_amount: Amount spent in a single transaction
2. transaction_frequency: How frequently the user transacts
3. location_score: Geolocation deviation from usual user location

## Model: 
Isolation Forest (Unsupervised anomaly detection)
