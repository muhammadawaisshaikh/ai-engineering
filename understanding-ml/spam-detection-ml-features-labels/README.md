# Features and Labels in Machine Learning: Spam Detection Usecase

In machine learning, especially in supervised learning, the terms features and labels play a crucial role. Features are the input variables or attributes that provide the information the model needs to learn patterns from the data. Labels, on the other hand, are the outcomes or targets that the model is trained to predict. For example, in a spam detection system, features might include the frequency of specific words like “free” or “buy now,” the total length of the email, the presence of hyperlinks or attachments, and the sender’s reputation. 

These features help the model analyze the characteristics of each email. The label in this case is a binary value indicating whether the email is spam (1) or not spam (0). By learning from many such labeled examples, the model can generalize and start making predictions on new, unseen data. This fundamental separation between features and labels allows machine learning systems to automate decision-making tasks across a wide range of domains.
